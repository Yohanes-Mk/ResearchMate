Developed ResearchMate, an autonomous multi-agent research assistant integrating arXiv/PubMed APIs + Gemini LLMs to synthesize literature and export structured PDFs (<2 min/topic, ~85% relevance).

Engineered a config-driven pipeline (Research→Summariser→Editor) with modular tools and ReportLab export; reproducible via CLI.
